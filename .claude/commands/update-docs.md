description: Update README.md and CLAUDE.md based on recent changes
---

Update project documentation to reflect all changes since the last commit:

1. **Read both documentation files completely**:
   - Read the entire README.md file
   - Read the entire CLAUDE.md file
   
2. **Identify changes that need documentation**:
   - New classes or features added
   - Changed class hierarchies or relationships
   - Modified build system or dependencies
   - New controls or gameplay features
   - Updated test coverage
   - Changed architecture patterns

3. **Update CLAUDE.md** (technical documentation):
   - Add new classes to the class hierarchy diagram
   - Document new class members, methods, and usage
   - Update architecture patterns if changed
   - Add new common pitfalls or best practices
   - Update test file list if new tests added
   - Ensure all code examples are accurate

4. **Update README.md** (user-facing documentation):
   - Update feature list for new gameplay features
   - Add new controls if any
   - Update build instructions if dependencies changed
   - Add screenshots or examples for major new features
   - Update project description if scope changed

5. **Verify consistency**:
   - Ensure both files are consistent with each other
   - Check that all referenced files/classes actually exist
   - Verify code examples compile
   - Ensure formatting is consistent (markdown, code blocks, etc.)

Provide a summary of what was updated in each file and why.
